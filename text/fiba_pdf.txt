A foul by either team:  
• 
Before the start of a quarter other than the first quarter or an overtime, or 
•

The last free throw is successful. 
• 
The last free throw, if not successful, is followed by a throw-in.

• 
A foul is committed before the ball becomes live after the last free throw. In this 
case the substitution shall be permitted before the new foul penalty is 
administered. 
•

this case the substitution shall be permitted before the throw-in is administered. 
In the event of consecutive sets of free throws and/or possession of the ball resulting 
from more than 1 foul penalty, each set is to be treated separately.

• 
The front by the palms of the hands, 
• 
The rear by the buttocks, and 
• 
The sides by the outer edge of the arms and legs. 
The hands and arms may be extended in front of the torso no further than the position 
of the feet and knees, with the arms bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands 
are raised in the legal guarding position.  
The defensive player may not enter the cylinder of the offensive player with the ball 
and cause an illegal contact when the offensive player is attempting a normal 
basketball play within his/her cylinder. The boundaries of the cylinder of the offensive 
player with the ball are: 
• 
The front by the feet, bent knees and arms, holding the ball above the hips, 
• 
The rear by the buttocks, and 
• 
The sides by the outer edge of elbows and legs. 
The offensive player with the ball must be allowed enough space for a normal basket-
ball play within his/her cylinder. The normal basketball play includes starting a 
dribble, pivoting, shooting and passing.  
The offensive player cannot spread his/her legs or arms outside of his/her cylinder 
and cause an illegal contact with the defensive player in order to gain an additional 
space.

Cylinder principle 
33.2 
Principle of verticality 
During the game, each player has the right to occupy any position (cylinder) on the 
court not already occupied by an opponent.  
This principle protects the space on the court which he/she occupies and the space 
above him/her when he/she jumps vertically within that space. 
When the player leaves his/her vertical position (cylinder) and body contact occurs 
with an opponent who had already established his/her own vertical position 
(cylinder), the player who left his/her vertical position (cylinder) is responsible for the 
contact. 
The defensive player must not be penalised for leaving the court vertically (within 
his/her cylinder) or having his/her hands and arms extended above him/her within 
his/her own cylinder. 
The offensive player, whether on the court or airborne, shall not cause contact with 
the defensive player in a legal guarding position by: 
• 
Using his/her arms to create more space for himself (pushing off). 
• 
Spreading his/her legs or arms during or immediately after a shot for a goal. 
33.3 
Legal guarding position 
A defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position when:  
• 
He is facing his/her opponent, and 
• 
He has both feet on the court. 
The legal guarding position extends vertically above him/her (cylinder) from the court 
to the ceiling. He/she may raise his/her arms and hands above his/her head or jump 
vertically but he/she must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary 
cylinder.  
33.4 
Guarding a player who controls the ball 
When guarding a player who controls (holding or dribbling) the ball, the elements of 
time and distance do not apply.  
The player with the ball must expect to be guarded and must be prepared to stop or 
change his/her direction whenever an opponent takes an initial legal guarding 
position in front of him, even if this is done within a fraction of a second. 
The guarding (defensive) player must establish an initial legal guarding position 
without causing contact before taking his/her position. 

 
 
 
 
Page 40 of 104 
OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2022 
October 2022 / v1.1 
Once the defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he/she 
may move to guard his/her opponent, but he/she may not extend his/her arms, 
shoulders, hips or legs to prevent the dribbler from passing by him. 
When judging a charge/block situation involving a player with the ball, a referee shall 
use the following principles:  
• 
The defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position by facing 
the player with the ball and having both feet on the court. 
• 
The defensive player may remain stationary, jump vertically, move laterally or 
backwards in order to maintain the initial legal guarding position. 
• 
When moving to maintain the initial legal guarding position, one foot or both feet 
may be off the court for an instant, as long as the movement is lateral or 
backwards, but not towards the player with the ball. 
• 
Contact must occur on the torso, in which case the defensive player would be 
considered as having been at the place of contact first. 
• 
Having established a legal guarding position, the defensive player may turn 
within his/her cylinder to avoid injury. 
In any of the above situations, the contact shall be considered as having been caused 
by the player with the ball. 
33.5 
Guarding a player who does not control the ball 
A player who does not control the ball is entitled to move freely on the court and take 
any position not already occupied by another player.  
When guarding a player who does not control the ball, the elements of time and 
distance shall apply. A defensive player cannot take a position so near and/or so 
quickly in the path of a moving opponent that the latter does not have sufficient time 
or distance either to stop or change his/her direction. 
The distance is directly proportional to the speed of the opponent, but never less than 
1 normal step. 
If a defensive player does not respect the elements of time and distance in taking 
his/her initial legal guarding position and contact with an opponent occurs, he/she is 
responsible for the contact. 
Once a defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position, he/she may 
move to guard his/her opponent. He/she may not prevent him/her from passing by 
extending his/her arms, shoulders, hips or legs in his/her path. He/she may turn within 
his/her cylinder to avoid injury. 
33.6 
A player who is in the air 
A player who has jumped into the air from a place on the court has the right to land 
again at the same place.  
He has the right to land on another place on the court provided that the landing place 
and the direct path between the take-off and landing place is not already occupied 
by an opponent(s) at the time of take-off. 
If a player has taken off and landed but his/her momentum causes him/her to contact 
an opponent who has taken a legal guarding position beyond the landing place, the 
jumper is responsible for the contact. 
An opponent may not move into the path of a player after that player has jumped into 
the air. 

 
 
 
 
October 2022 / v1.1 
OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2022 
Page 41 of 104 
Moving under a player who is in the air and causing contact is usually an unsports-
manlike foul and in certain circumstances may be a disqualifying foul. 
33.7 
Screening: Legal and illegal 
Screening is an attempt to delay or prevent an opponent without the ball from 
reaching a desired position on the court.  
Legal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: 
• 
Was stationary (inside his/her cylinder) when contact occurred. 
• 
Had both feet on the court when contact occurred. 
Illegal screening is when the player who is screening an opponent: 
• 
Was moving when contact occurred. 
• 
Did not give sufficient distance in setting a screen outside the field of vision of a 
stationary opponent when contact occurred. 
• 
Did not respect the elements of time and distance of an opponent in motion when 
contact occurred. 
If the screen is set within the field of vision of a stationary opponent (front or lateral), 
the screener may establish the screen as close to him/her as he/she wishes, provided 
there is no contact. 
If the screen is set outside the field of vision of a stationary opponent, the screener 
must permit the opponent to take 1 normal step towards the screen without making 
contact. 
If the opponent is in motion, the elements of time and distance shall apply. The 
screener must leave enough space so that the player who is being screened is able 
to avoid the screen by stopping or changing direction. 
The distance required is never less than 1 and never more than 2 normal steps. 
A player who is legally screened is responsible for any contact with the player who 
has set the screen. 
33.8 
Charging 
Charging is illegal personal contact, with or without the ball, by pushing or moving 
into an opponent’s torso.  
33.9 
Blocking 
Blocking is illegal personal contact which impedes the progress of an opponent with 
or without the ball.  
A player who is attempting to screen is committing a blocking foul if contact occurs 
when he/she is moving, and his/her opponent is stationary or retreating from him/her.  
If a player disregards the ball, faces an opponent and shifts his/her position as the 
opponent shifts, he/she is primarily responsible for any contact that occurs, unless 
other factors are involved. 
The expression 'unless other factors are involved' refers to deliberate pushing, 
charging or holding of the player who is being screened. 
It is legal for a player to extend his/her arm(s) or elbow(s) outside of his/her cylinder 
in taking position on the court but they must be moved inside his/her cylinder when 

 
 
 
 
Page 42 of 104 
OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2022 
October 2022 / v1.1 
an opponent attempts to pass by. If the arm(s) or elbow(s) are outside his/her cylinder 
and contact occurs, it is blocking or holding. 
33.10 
No-charge semi-circle areas 
The no-charge semi-circle areas are drawn on the court for the purpose of 
designating a specific area for the interpretation of charge/block situations under the 
basket.  
On any penetration play into the no-charge semi-circle area any contact caused by 
an airborne offensive player with a defensive player inside the no-charge semi-circle 
shall not be called as a team control foul, unless the offensive player is illegally using 
his/her hands, arms, legs or body. This rule applies when: 
• 
The offensive player is in control of the ball whilst airborne, and 
• 
He attempts a shot for a goal or passes the ball, and 
• 
The defensive player has one foot or both feet in contact with the no-charge 
semi-circle area. 
33.11 
Contacting an opponent with the hand(s) and/or arm(s) 
The touching of an opponent with the hand(s) is, in itself, not necessarily a foul.  
The referees shall decide whether the player who caused the contact has gained an 
advantage. If contact caused by a player in any way restricts the freedom of 
movement of an opponent, such contact is a foul. 
Illegal use of the hand(s) or extended arm(s) occurs when the defensive player is in 
a guarding position and his/her hand(s) or arm(s) is placed upon and remains in 
contact with an opponent with or without the ball, to impede his/her progress. 
To repeatedly touch or 'jab' an opponent with or without the ball is a foul, as it may 
lead to rough play. 
It is a foul by an offensive player with the ball to: 
• 
'Hook' or wrap an arm or an elbow around a defensive player in order to obtain 
an advantage. 
• 
'Push off' the defensive player to prevent him/her from playing or attempting to 
play the ball, or to create more space for himself. 
• 
Use an extended forearm or hand, while dribbling, to prevent an opponent from 
gaining control of the ball. 
It is a foul by an offensive player without the ball to 'push off' to: 
• 
Get free to catch the ball. 
• 
Prevent the defensive player from playing or attempting to play the ball. 
• 
Create more space for him. 
33.12 
Post play 
The principle of verticality (cylinder principle) applies also to post play.  
The offensive player in the post position and the defensive player guarding him/her 
must respect each other's rights to a vertical position (cylinder). 
It is a foul by an offensive or defensive player in the post position to shoulder or hip 
his/her opponent out of position or to interfere with his/her opponent’s freedom of 
movement using extended arms, shoulders, hips, legs or other parts of the body.

OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2022 
Page 43 of 104 
33.13 
Illegal guarding from the rear 
Illegal guarding from the rear is personal contact with an opponent, by a defensive 
player, from behind. The fact that the defensive player is attempting to play the ball 
does not justify his/her contact with an opponent from the rear.  
33.14 
Holding 
Holding is illegal personal contact with an opponent that interferes with his/her 
freedom of movement. This contact (holding) can occur with any part of the body.  
33.15 
Pushing 
Pushing is illegal personal contact with any part of the body where a player forcibly 
moves or attempts to move an opponent with or without the ball.  
33.16 
Fake being fouled 
Fake is any action by a player to simulate that he/she has been fouled or to make 
theatrical exaggerated movements in order to create an opinion of being fouled and 
therefore gaining an advantage.

B.10.3 
Each main column is divided into 4 columns. The 2 on the left are 
for team 'A' and the 2 on the right for team 'B'. The centre columns 
are for the running score (160 points) for each team. 
The scorer shall: 
• 
First, draw a diagonal line (/ for right-handed or \ for left-
handed) for any valid goal scored and a filled circle (l) for 
any valid free throw scored, over the new total number of 
points as accumulated by the team that has just scored. 
• 
Then, in the blank space on the same side of the new total 
number of points (beside the new / or \ or l), enter the num-
ber of the player who scored the goal or the free throw. 
B.11 
The running score: Additional instructions 
B.11.1 
A 3-point goal scored by a player shall be entered with drawing a 
circle around the player's number. 
B.11.2 
A goal accidentally scored by a player in his/her own basket shall 
be entered as having been scored by the captain of the 
opponents’ team on the court. 
B.11.3 
Points scored when the ball does not enter the basket (Article 31) 
shall be entered as having been scored by the player who attemp-
ted the shot. 
B.11.4 
At the end of each quarter or overtimes, the scorer shall draw a 
thick circle (¢) around the latest number of points scored by each 
team, followed by a thick horizontal line under those points and 
under the number of each player who scored those last points. 
B.11.5 
At the start of each quarter or overtimes the scorer shall continue 
to keep a chronological running summary of the points scored 
from the point of interruption. 
B.11.6 
Whenever possible, the scorer should check his/her running 
score with the visual scoreboard. If there is a discrepancy, and 
his/her score is correct, he/she shall immediately take steps to 
have the scoreboard corrected. If in doubt or if one of the teams 
raises an objection to the correction, he/she shall inform the crew 
chief when the ball becomes dead and the game clock is stopped. 
B.11.7 
The referees may correct any error in scorekeeping involving the 
score, number of fouls or number of time-outs under the provi-
sions of the rules. The crew chief shall sign the corrections. 
Extensive corrections shall be documented on the reverse side of 
the scoresheet.

The running score: Summing up 
B.12.1 
At the end of each quarter and last overtime, the scorer shall 
enter the score of that quarter and of all overtimes in the proper 
section in the lower part of the scoresheet. 
B.12.2 
Immediately at the end of the game, the scorer shall enter the 
time in the ‘Game ended at (hh:mm)’ column. 
B.12.3 
At the end of the game, the scorer shall draw 2 thick horizontal 
lines under the final number of points scored by each team and 
the numbers of the players who scored those last points. He/she 
shall also draw a diagonal line to the bottom of the column in 
order to obliterate the remaining numbers (running score) for 
each team. 
B.12.4 
At the end of the game, the scorer shall enter the final score and 
the name of the winning team. 
B.12.5 
All table officials shall then sign the scoresheet next to their 
names. 
B.12.6 
The crew chief, after the scoresheet is signed by the umpire(s), 
shall be the last to approve and sign the scoresheet. This act 
terminates the referees’ administration and connection with the 
game.

 Summing up 
Note: Should the captain (CAP) sign the scoresheet under protest (using the 
'Captain's signature in case of protest' column), the table officials and the 
umpire(s) shall remain at the disposal of the crew chief until he/she gives them 
the permission to leave.

APPENDIX C – PROTEST PROCEDURE 
C.1 
A team may file a protest if its interests have been adversely affected by: 
a) An error in scorekeeping, timekeeping or shot clock operations, which was not 
corrected by the referees. 
b) A decision to forfeit, cancel, postpone, not resume or not play the game. 
c) A violation of the applicable eligibility rules. 
C.2 
In order to be admissible, a protest shall comply with the following procedure: 
a) The captain (CAP) of that team shall, no later than 15 minutes following the end 
of the game, inform the crew chief that his/her team is protesting against the 
result of the game and sign the scoresheet in the 'Captain's signature in case of 
protest' column. 
b) The team shall submit the protest reasons to the crew chief in writing no later 
than 1 hour following the end of the game. 
c) A fee of CHF 1,500 shall be applied to each protest and shall be paid in case the 
protest is rejected. 
C.3 
The crew chief (or commissioner, if present) shall, following receipt of the protest 
reasons, report in writing the incident which leads to the protest, to the FIBA 
representative or to the competent body. 
C.4 
The competent body shall issue any procedural requests which it deems appropriate 
and shall decide on the protest immediately, and in any event no later than 24 hours 
following the end of the game. The competent body shall use any reliable evidence 
and can take any appropriate decision, including without limitation partial or full 
replay of the game. The competent body may not decide to change the result of the 
game unless there is clear and conclusive evidence that, had it not been for the error 
that gave rise to the protest, the new result would have certainly materialised. 
C.5 
The decision of the competent body is also considered as a field of play rule decision 
and is not subject to further review or appeal. Exceptionally, decisions on eligibility 
may be appealed as provided for in the applicable regulations. 
C.6 
Special rules for FIBA competitions or competitions which do not provide otherwise 
in their regulations: 
a) In case the competition is in tournament format, the competent body for all 
protests shall be the Technical Committee (see FIBA Internal Regulations, 
Book 2). 
b) In case of home and away games, the competent body for protests relating to 
eligibility issues shall be the FIBA Disciplinary Panel. For all other issues giving 
rise to a protest, the competent body shall be FIBA acting through one or more 
persons with expertise on the implementation and interpretation of the Official 
Basketball Rules (see FIBA Internal Regulations, Book 2).

APPENDIX D – CLASSIFICATION OF TEAMS 
D.1 
Procedure 
D.1.1 
Teams shall be classified according to their win-loss record, namely 2 classification 
points for each game won, 1 classification point for each game lost (including lost by 
default) and 0 classification points for a game lost by forfeit.  
D.1.2 
The procedure shall be used for all competitions with a round-robin system. 
D.1.3 
If 2 or more teams have the same win-loss record of all games in the group, the 
game(s) between these 2 or more teams shall decide on the classification. If these 2 
or more teams have the same win-loss record of the games between them, further 
criteria shall be used in the following order: 
• 
Higher game points difference of the games between them. 
• 
Higher number of game points scored in the games between them. 
• 
Higher game points difference of all games in the group. 
• 
Higher number of game points scored in all games in the group. 
If still tied before all games have been played in the group, tied teams shall share the 
same ranking. If these criteria still cannot decide at the end of the group phase, the 
relevant FIBA ranking shall decide on the final classification. 
D.1.4 
If at any level of these criteria one or more team(s) are already classified, the proce-
dure of D.1.3 shall be repeated from the start for all the remaining teams not classified 
yet.

Cross-group classifications 
D.4.1 
In order to classify teams across groups (e. g. to determine the best second or third 
placed teams), the following criteria shall be used. 
If all teams in all groups have played the same number of games, the teams on the 
same position in each group shall be placed in one group and the following criteria 
shall be used in the following order 
• Better win-loss record of all games played in their revised final group standings. 
• Higher game points difference of all games in their revised final group standings. 
• Higher number of the game points scored in all games in their revised final group 
standings. 
• If these criteria still cannot decide, the relevant FIBA ranking shall decide on the 
final classification.

If after grouping the teams on the same position in each group, these teams have 
played a different number of games in their respective groups, then the games of the 
last placed team in the group or groups of the teams with the most games shall be 
nullified. This process shall be repeated across all groups until the number of games 
are the same across all groups. The following criteria shall then apply: 
• Better win-loss record of all games played in their revised final group standings. 
• Higher game points difference of all games in their revised final group standings. 
• Higher number of the game points scored in all games in their revised final group 
standings. 
• If these criteria still cannot decide, the relevant FIBA ranking shall decide on the 
final classification. 
Note: 
For the avoidance of doubt, the annulation of games referred above, for the purposes 
of cross-group classifications, shall not alter the initial standing of teams in a 
particular group.

E.2 
Rule 
E.2.1 
In each quarter 1 Media time-out is permitted, in addition to the regular team time-
outs. Media time-outs in an overtime are not permitted.

E.3.1 
Ideally, the Media time-out shall be taken before the 5:00 minutes remaining in the 
quarter. However, there is no guarantee that this shall be the case. 
E.3.2 
If neither team has requested a time-out before the 5:00 minutes remaining in the 
quarter then a Media time-out shall be granted at the first opportunity when the ball 
is dead and the game clock is stopped. This time-out shall not be charged against 
either team. 
E.3.3 
If either team is granted a time-out before the 5:00 minutes remaining in the quarter, 
that time-out shall be used as a Media time-out. 
This time-out shall count as both a Media time-out and a team time-out for the team 
requesting it. 
E.3.4 
According to this procedure, there would be a minimum of 1 time-out in each quarter 
and a maximum of 6 time-outs in the first half and a maximum of 8 time-outs in the

F.4 
Head coach’s challenge 
F.4.1 
In all games where the Instant Replay System (IRS) is used the head coach may 
request a head coach’s challenge, i. e. ask the nearest referee to verify the decision 
of referees by using the IRS to review the game situation. 
F.4.2 
For the head coach’s challenge the following procedure shall apply: 
• 
The head coach shall be granted only one head coach’s challenge in a game, 
regardless of whether the challenge is successful or not. 
• 
Only the game situations as in the Appendix F.3 may be challenged. 
• 
The time restrictions within Appendix F.3 do not apply. The head coach’s 
challenge may be requested at any time in the game. 
• 
The head coach requesting a challenge shall establish visual contact with the 
nearest referee and ask clearly for his/her head coach`s challenge. He/she shall 
say loudly in English “challenge” and at the same time show the head coach’s 
challenge signal (drawing a rectangular with the hands). The request shall be 
final and irreversible. 
• 
The head coach must request the challenge and the review must take place at 
the latest when the referees have stopped the game for the first time after the 
decision. 
• 
If the game continued without a stoppage the referees are authorised to stop the 
game immediately when they recognise a head coach’s challenge unless neither 
team shall be placed at a disadvantage. 
• 
The head coach shall indicate to the nearest referee the game situation to be 
reviewed. 
• 
The referee shall notify the scorer, using his/her signal No. 58 that the head 
coach’s challenge has been granted. 
• 
During the review the players shall remain on the court. 
• 
If the review provides the challenged decision is in favour of the requesting team 
the initial decision shall be overturned. 
• 
If the review provides the challenged decision is not in favour of the requesting 
team the initial decision shall remain. 
• 
The referees shall use the same procedure as in the review rule. 
• 
After the referee has reported the final decision of the review, the game shall be 
resumed as after any review.
